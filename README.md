Created by :- Ankit Mawle\`
Internship provided by :- VLSI System Design\
Internship Date:- 26 March 2025 to 6 April 2025\
Internship details website:- [VLSISystemDesign_Packaging](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/packaging/)

## Tools Used

- **ANSYS Icepak** â€“ For thermal and mechanical simulations
- **ANSYS Q3D** - For packaging design for simulation

## Overview

This repository contains structured notes for theory as well as  simulation-based labs focused on semiconductor packaging as performed under Ansys Semiconductor Packaging course conducted during the [VSD Internship Program](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/packaging) in March 2025.

The objective of this repository is to bridge the gap between chip design and system-level integration by understanding the critical role of packaging in the semiconductor design flow.

## Topics Covered

1. **Introduction to Packaging**
   - What is Semiconductor Packaging?
   - Importance in chip reliability and performance

2. **Types of Packaging**
   - Wire Bonding, Flip Chip, Wafer Level Packaging (WLP), 2.5D, and 3D Integration
   - Comparative analysis of different packaging techniques

3. **Assembly and Manufacturing**
   - Overview of wafer-to-package process
   - Key manufacturing steps and materials

4. **Thermal Analysis with Ansys**
   - Heat dissipation challenges
   - Performing thermal simulations using Ansys tools

5. **Reliability and Testing**
   - Package reliability metrics
   - Structural and mechanical simulations
   - Failure mechanisms and test methods

6. **Advanced Topics**
   - Package co-design
   - High-density interconnects
   - Future trends in packaging (Chiplets, Heterogeneous Integration)



## About the Internship

This work was carried out as part of the VSD Semiconductor Packaging Internship conducted in March 2025, with a strong focus on practical application of Ansys tools in chip-package co-design.
